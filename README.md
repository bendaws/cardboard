# Cardboard
Cardboard is a collection of game development utilies for the Roblox platform designed to make debugging and writing code easier. It is fast and modular with a minimal amount of fatal errors that can occur.

## History
Cardboard was created in 2022 to help aid the development of my FPS shooter game called stupid shooters. After I stopped working on that project, I continued the development as Cardboard 2.0 for multiple games. I decided to rewrite Cardboard as well as make it open-source with 3.0 in 2024. This repo contains the source code for Cardboard.

I am still rewriting it and it has been a work-in-progress since November 2024.

## Installation
- Roblox store page: [After 3.1 release]
- Source code: [bendaws/cardboard/releases](https://github.com/bendaws/cardboard/releases)

You can drop the source code directly into your project as long as you use the "rbx-translation" directory.

## License
Cardboard has adapted it's own license, Ben's Open-Source License V3. I wrote this license myself and it is simular to the MIT License.
